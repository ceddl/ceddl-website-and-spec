The working group is currently promoting the concepts discribed in this polyfill. furthermore time is being invested into a technical specification that should allow browsers vendors to implement a frontend datalayer into the browser. Writing a technical specification is hard. What information do browser developers actually need? How detailed should the specification be? Should it contain a lot of context or be purely technical?
