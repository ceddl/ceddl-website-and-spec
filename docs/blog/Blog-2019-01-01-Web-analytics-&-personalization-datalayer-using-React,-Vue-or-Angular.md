Probably, a development teams that has invested into a front-end mv* framework is going to be the most difficult to convince. They might have a different approach or think of the effort it will take to implement a web datalayer, but my experience shows that with a couple of examples, once they understand it, they will support the concept. We set out two months ago with the intent of providing these examples.

Links to code repository's for <a href="https://github.com/ceddl/ceddl-with-react/">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceddl/ceddl-with-vue/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceddl/ceddl-with-angular/">AngularJS</a>

The applications demonstrate compatibility with the major front-end mv* frameworks. Show that leveraging the template engines and data models, greatly improves data quality and will simplify development effort.

### On top of TodoMVC

It can be hard to make the leap from hacking together code that works to writing code that`s organized, maintainable, reusable, and a joy to work on. We decided to implement on top of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). This project does a great job of introducing developers to different approaches to code organization. It offers the same Todo application implemented using MV concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MVframeworks of today.
