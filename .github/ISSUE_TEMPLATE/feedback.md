Here are a few questions that will tee us up for a good conversation:

- Can you tell me about your project in a few sentences?
- How did you hear about this polyfill? What specifically interests you about it?
- What environment are you using ceddl-polyfill in and what does your technology stack look like.
- How large is your team?
- Are you talking to others about this project? Wat would you prefer as a communication channel?
- Anything else that we should know about?

Thanks!
