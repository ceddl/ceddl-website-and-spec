In February 2018, I gathered 6 code projects and many insights from the last five years. Converting them to actionable
items and changing them so the idea became generic and implementable in a browser. Prioritizing the things on a
whiteboard resulted in taking two weeks off from work to write a polyfill. A polyfill that exposes HTML attribute-based
markup and javascript API for surfacing digital data on a web application intended for web analytics, website
personalization, and DMP implementations. The number of users has been growing steadily since then to 500 downloads per
week.

Now is 2022, I got some time between consultancy jobs and am reading up on the {{< rawhtml >}}

<a class="link no-underline" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations_en">
European Commission</a>{{</rawhtml >}} is trying to influence this space without having the tools to directly impact the
market and browser vendors. An example. If you walk into a shop, you expect to talk openly to the shop employee. If the
employee records information for performing and improving service, this makes sense. What you do not expect is to do
your
shopping in the cafe where there are listening ears all around observing and providing you with advice at any moment.
Can we enable businesses to do marketing, personalization, surveys, web/app improvement programs, market segmentation,
web analytics, etc without placing my data on the local bars table?

It feels like it is time for a new direction. A strategy that shows by example and is not limited to the browser.
