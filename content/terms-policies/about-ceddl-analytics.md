# About CEDDL Analytics
----------------------

Ceddl Analytics is the corporate service that monitors and evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the
ceddlbyexample.com domain. Ceddl Analytics is installed on a webserver. Both the infrastructure and software are under
the full control of the owner of ceddlbyexample.com domain.

Ceddl Analytics' privacy protection has been validated by the ceddlbyexample.com team members as our organization is not
big enough for a Data Protection Officer as described in the Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 on the protection of personal
data.

Ceddl Analytics is maintained by ceddlbyexample team members. Separate instances are provided as a paid service to
website owners across the globe to ensure that business workflows can be automated, provide relevant communications and
are cost-efficient.

The service is present on ceddlbyexample websites and pages under the ceddlbyexample.com domain and its subdomains.


## Data protection Information and measures
----------------------------------------

**First party cookies**

Ceddl Analytics for ceddlbyexample.com is configured to only use the domain ceddlbyexample.com and to store
first-party cookies that expire and will be automatically removed from the user’s device after 12 months.

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor’s computer or mobile device. There are two types
of cookies – session and persistent cookies.

Cookies used by Ceddl Analytics enable ceddlbyexample to collect the following information about visitors that
is used to prepare aggregated, anonymous statistics reports of visitors’ activity

* internet protocol (IP)address (anonymised)
* location: country, region, city, approximate latitude and longitude (geolocation)
* date and time of the request (visit to the site)
* title of the page being viewed (page title)
* URL of the page being viewed (page URL)
* URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page (referrer URL)
* screen resolution of the user's device
* local time in visitor's time zone
* files that were clicked and downloaded (download)
* links to an outside domain that were clicked (outlink)
* time on site
* time on page
* mouse or hand gesture locations.
* page generation time: the time it takes for webpages to be generated by the webserver and then downloaded by the
  visitor (page speed)
* main language of the browser being used (accept language header)
* browser version, browser plugins (PDF, Flash, Java) operating system version, device identifier (user agent header)
* language of the visited page
* campaigns
* site search
* events

To improve the accuracy of the reports, certain information is also stored in first party cookies and then collected by
Ceddl Analytics:

* random unique visitor ID
* time of the first visit by the specific visitor
* time of the previous visit by the specific visitor
* number of visits by the specific visitor

The European Commission retains full responsibility and control of the data collected through first party cookies by
storing the data in servers fully controlled by ceddlbyexample.

The data collected contains no personal information but may contain a userID and the random unique visitor ID that is
generated by the software cannot be used to directly identify a particular visitor. Data will not be shared with any
other organisations for marketing, market research or commercial purposes.
