  **Other Information**. ceddlbyexample also collects, generates and/or receives the following categories of Other
  Information:
    1) **Workspace and account information**: To create or update a Workspace account, you or our Customer (e.g.
       your employer) supply ceddlbyexample with an email address, phone number, password, domain, and/or other account
       set up details. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide ceddlbyexample (or
       its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information, and/or a
       billing address.
    2) **Usage information**:
        * **Services metadata**. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that

          and its settings.
        * **Location information**. We receive information from you, our Customers and other third-parties that helps us
          approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer (who is our

          with localization or for security purposes.
