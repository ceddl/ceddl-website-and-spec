The open source community and select partners are key in bringing together the technologies and teams we seek to have
impact. A digital data footprint is an unavoidable part of modern life. Therefor we work alongside consultancies and
agencies to help with data footprint analysis and control, seamless integrations, standardization and agility.

Our primary source of funding is a licensed low code environment for analytics and marketing behind
ceddl-polyfill. We run this environment with our select partners. If you’re interested, buying a license is the best way
to support the project and improve your business. We’ve also put together some sponsorship packages. Maintaining
open-source software is a time-consuming job. We release our code on GitHub to inspire and empower you. To improve the
web without distributing customer data all around the globe. Not because it’s good business. Sponsoring us is a great
way to give back to the community and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the project. Hey! With your help, we
might even get customer experience digital datalayer embedded in every browser on the planet. Thank you for supporting
independent creators of Free Open Source Software!
