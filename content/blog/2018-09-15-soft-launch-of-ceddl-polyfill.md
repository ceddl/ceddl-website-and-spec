title: Soft Launch of CEDDL Polyfill
date: 2018-09-15

The team has been working for 7 years implementing and inproving website marketing systems. After a complete rewrite of
the frontend datalayer solution in 2018, quality is good enouph to share and open source the polyfill online.

Our objective: Connecting web application to tags and marketing solutions in the browser is more difficult than ever
before. 3rd party injected javascript is doing lots of duplicate work and expecting sets of data to be sent in a vendor
specific format. CEDDL-Polyfill will streamline and simplify your data flow. Allowing developers to generate a
structured, testable and standardized data layer accros multiple Silos for web analytics, ads, website personalization,
and DMP implementations. Applying lessons learned by many implementations and bringing this back into a specification
that browsers will be able to implement.

The current state of the polyfill is to incubate on ideas, assist in writing a technical specification. Wondering what a
polyfill is? <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/polyfills/">Read more here</a>.
