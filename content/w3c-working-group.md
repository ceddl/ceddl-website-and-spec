The working group is currently promoting the concepts described in this polyfill. Furthermore, time is being invested
into a technical specification that should allow browser vendors to implement a frontend datalayer into the browser.
Writing a technical specification is hard. What information do browser developers actually need? How detailed should the
specification be? Should it contain a lot of contexts or be purely technical?

If you feel you can help/support us in any way, please do not hesitate to do so. If you would like to interact with me
or the community send us a message
on  [github feedback issue](https://github.com/ceddl/ceddl-website-and-spec/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=feedback.md&title=)
